## ABSTRACTION

__The Essence of Computer Science is Abstraction__:

The authors of the wonderful book Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming define ___[Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science))___ as any tool or device that solves a particular problem.

> ___[Abstractions](https://branislavjenco.github.io/desired-state-systems/)___ are central to what we do. I find that the most rewarding work is not writing programs but rather designing abstractions. Programming a computer is primarily designing and using abstractions to achieve new goals. Itâ€™s exciting when you can build something which hides away some of the underlying complexity and present a simpler interface for whoever or whatever is using your system.
