## THE LAWS OF IDENTITY

### User Control and Consent

_Technical identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent._

- The system needs mechanisms to make the user aware of the purposes for which any information is being collected.

### Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use

_The solution that discloses the least amount of identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable long-term solution._

- Best to acquire information only on a “need to know” basis, and to retain it only on a “need to retain” basis.

### Justifiable Parties

_Digital identity systems must be designed so the disclosure of identifying information is limited to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship._

### Directed Identity

_A universal identity system must support both “omni-directional” identifiers for use by public entities and “unidirectional” identifiers for use by private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles._

### Pluralism of Operators and Technologies

_A universal identity system must channel and enable the inter-working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers._

### Human Integration

_The universal identity metasystem must define the human user to be a component of the distributed system integrated through unambiguous human-machine communication mechanisms offering protection against identity attacks._

### Consistent Experience Across Contexts

_The unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies._
