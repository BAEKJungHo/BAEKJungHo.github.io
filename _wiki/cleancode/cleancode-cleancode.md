## CLEANCODE

Maintaining a high level of code quality is an action close to the essence.

___Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code read like well-written prose. Clean code can be read. It has [unit](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/test/test-effective-unittest/) and [acceptance tests](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/tdd/tdd-acceptance-test/). It has meaningful names. It has minimal [Dependency](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/architecture/architecture-dependency/).
Reduce duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple [Abstractions](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/architecture/architecture-abstraction/).___

___Test Drive the System Architecture - An optimal [system architectures](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/architecture/architecture-software/) consists of modularized domains of concern, each of which is implemented with [Plain Old Java Objects](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/spring/spring-pojo/), The different domains are integrated together with minimally invasive [Aspects](https://baekjungho.github.io/wiki/spring/spring-aop/) of Aspect-like tools. 
This architecture can be [test-driven](https://baekjungho.github.io/tag/#test), just like the code.___

___[Code Red: The Business Impact of Code Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04374) - With 15 times fewer defects, twice the development speed, and substantially more predictable issue resolution times, the business advantage of high quality code should be unmistakably clear.___
