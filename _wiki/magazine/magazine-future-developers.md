## The Future of Developers

With AI such as chatGPT becoming an issue, the time has come for developers to prepare for a second job change. 

I think it's time to go beyond just Backend Developers and Frontend Developers to target __Devops__, __Cloud Engineers__ and __Architects__.

1. Using tools like ChatGPT well
2. Application architecture design capabilities
3. Cloud Knowledge
4. Knowledge of MSA
5. The importance of Fundamentals such as network, OS, algorithm, and data structure
6. Communication Skills

The importance of the above items will be increasingly emphasized. In particular, I think 1, 2, 5 and 6 are too important.
