## Antifragile

In the context of Microservices Architecture (MSA), "antifragile" refers to a system's ability to withstand and even benefit from change, uncertainty, and stress. An antifragile MSA is one that can adapt and evolve as the needs of the organization change, without breaking or becoming unstable. This is achieved by breaking down a monolithic system into smaller, independent microservices that can be updated, scaled, and managed independently. The goal is to create a system that is not just robust and resilient, but actually thrives in the face of change.
